# Ramping up with professional Python

The goal of this documentation is to help you become a productive Python developer.

It assumes that those skills will be used in a professional environment. It includes concrete exercises, because the best way to learn is by doing. It focuses on real-world, applied documentation that will help your programming on a day-to-day basis.

This doc assumes programming knowledge and experience.

If you're also interested in generic programming best practices, I've compiled a list of [professional programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) resources.

# Learning the language

## Beginner

First, [Why Beginners Should Learn Python](http://stackabuse.com/why-beginners-should-learn-python/)

Here are some free books:

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/): slow
  introduction, suitable for people with limited programming language
  experience.
- [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html): much faster
  introduction to Python, a bit outdated but will get you ramped up really
  fast, especially if you've learned a number of programming language in the
  past. There's a version for [Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/) as
  well.
- [Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html): Python's
  official doc is really good, highly recommended read.

[The Python Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/) has
some other good resources.

If you're coming from another language, read this article about the [ten myths of enterprise Python](https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/10-myths-of-enterprise-python-8302b8f21f82).

If you want to review algorithms at the same time, you can use [Problem Solving
with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) by Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum.

Other resources include (prefer the one listed above):

- [Automate the boring stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters/)
- [Learn python3 in one picture](https://github.com/coodict/python3-in-one-pic)

To find other list of resources:

[Learn Python online – A curated list of courses on Python](http://bafflednerd.com/learn-python-online/)

## Intermediate

### An introduction to advanced Python

I wrote some introductory material to advanced Python:

- [Introduction to advanced Python](advanced_python/advanced_python.md) (article). [Advanced Python presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/charlax/introduction-to-advanced-python) (Slideshare).

### Articles, videos and presentations

- [py-must-watch](https://github.com/s16h/py-must-watch)

### Books

- Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid, [Intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)
- Luciano Ramalho, [Fluent Python](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491946008/)
- Dusty Phillips, [Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784398780/)
- Brett Slatkin, [Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134034287/)

## Writing idiomatic Python

First things first, let's get **code style** out of the way. Make sure you've read and memorized [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (code style, [more readable version here](http://pep8.org/)) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) (docstring style). Those two code styles are applied by almost all major Python applications and libraries. Use flake8, autopep8 and black to ensure they are applied.

What is called "idiomatic Python" might feel magical at first, especially if you don't know Python. I'd recommend getting your hands dirty with some real world Python code. Try to wander around the code, opening random files. Run the tutorial with a debugger to follow the flow and understand what's going on.

- [bottle.py](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py): bottle is a web framework. It's a great resource because it's in all in whole file!
  Recommended reading. You can even print it.
- [flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask): another web framework, one of the best. Reading its code is highly recommended as well.

You can find other ideas on [this hacker news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9896369).

I feel it's more important to understand the vision behind Python's design, than to know specific Python idioms. The Zen of Python will help you understand the fundamental reasoning behind each idiom.

```

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

Learning idiomatic Python:

- [Meditations on the Zen of Python](https://orbifold.xyz/zen-of-python.html)

List of books:

- [Awesome Python Books](https://github.com/Junnplus/awesome-python-books)

# Exercises

The best way to learn is to do.

## Small exercises

- Create a virtual environment with `virtualenv`.
- Create a virtual environment with `virtualenvwrapper` tools.
- Fix a bug in one of the Python packages listed in [the Python guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#scenario-guide).
- Create a server exposing a Thrift API.
- Take inspiration from this [list of Raspberry Pi projects on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4e59wb/what_have_you_done_with_python_and_raspberry_pi/)

## Larger projects

- [Discover Flask](https://github.com/realpython/discover-flask)
- Build a lock library for redis.
- Build a cache library for redis.
- Build an API for next bus departure time.
- Build an ORM for a SQL database.
- Build a command line parser.
- Build a template engine.
- Build a static site generator.
- Build an HTTP library.
- Clone one of those [games](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/)
- Solve some of the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/)
- Write a game using [pyarcade](http://pythonhosted.org/arcade/index.html)

Reddit's [dailyprogrammer subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
has some good exercises as well.

Another great way to learn Python is by contributing to one of the numerous
open source libraries. Coding is not something that is to be learn in
isolation, and you'll learn great valuable insights from the code review you'll
get from those communities. You can look for tickets (e.g. Github issues) for
Python libraries you're using, or find some in the list below, or pick one of
the libraries listed in [Awesome
Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Make sure you pick a library
where the tickets are not too involved, and where the community is still alive
(i.e. there's recent merged pull requests).

# Ramping up with specific libraries

Regardless of whether you use them, those tutorials introduce you to important
concept and good design patterns, so they're highly recommended:

- Do the [Flask tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/).
- Watch the [SQLAlchemy introduction
  video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P141KRbxVKc). It lasts 3 hours but is
  extremely insightful, and introduces to some great object oriented patterns.

Other great SQLAlchemy resources include:

- [Handcoded application with SQLAlchemy](http://pyvideo.org/video/665/hand-coded-applications-with-sqlalchemy)

Other specific libraries that are very often used in professional
environments:

- [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) is an asynchronous task queue/job
  queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time
  operation, but supports scheduling as well.
- [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) is a Python web framework and
  asynchronous networking library.
- [Alembic](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a lightweight
  database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for
  Python.
- [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) is a full featured template engine for
  Python. It has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed
  execution environment, widely used and BSD licensed.
- [Mock](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/) is a library for testing in
  Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock
  objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
- [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) is a test framework.

[Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) provides a great list
of third party libraries.

## Tests

Half of coding time is usually spent writing tests. Yet how to write tests
efficiently is very rarely taught at school - even though it came make a huge
difference in engineering productivity and quality.

First, make sure you're familiar with the different kind of testing strategies
laid out in [Testing Strategies in a Microservices
Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (Martin
Fowler).

Then, read some of those articles:

- [Mock yourself, not your
  tests](http://hernantz.github.io/mock-yourself-not-your-tests.html): great
  articles about the danger of mocking, and better unit testing strategies.
- [Building Good Tests](https://salmonmode.github.io//2019/03/29/building-good-tests.html), Chris NeJame
  _ 1 assert per test function/method and nothing else
  _ Use standard assert statements, instead of the unittest.TestCase assert methods
  _ Test behavior, not implementation
  _ Only verify state-changing method calls
  _ Test the result, not the process
  _ Every test should be able to be run in parallel with any other test
  _ A test should never be flaky
  _ Try to avoid mocking things whenever possible.
  _ Test coverage is not a metric for what was tested; it’s a metric for what code your tests managed to hit
  _ The code should be easy to test \* Make your test code succinct and idiomatic

## Types

- [The state of type hints in Python](https://www.bernat.tech/the-state-of-type-hints-in-python/): a good summary of typing in Python and its gotchas.

## Unicode

- [Solving Unicode Problems in Python 2.7](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/labs/2014/03/solving-unicode-problems-in-python-2-7/)
- [Unicode Howto in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html) (official Python documentation).
